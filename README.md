# wiki-wiki
All public wikis, in one place. Hypothesis: Not enough people know about various wikis, and they are sometimes hard to find via web search.

## todo
Make this an actual wiki!  
Create a website for it  
Add easy-to-use crowdsourcing functionality to it (so that people and AIs can add wikis w/o having to make a pull request)
