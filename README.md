# Wiki Wiki

All public wikis, in one place.

Hypothesis: Not enough people know about various wikis, and they are sometimes hard to find via web search.


## Wikis

### [EverybodyWiki](https://en.everybodywiki.com)

## Todo

### Prios
Look for other similar wiki gathering efforts out there and include them here  

### Tasks
Make this an actual wiki!  
Create a website for it  
Add easy-to-use crowdsourcing functionality to it (so that people and AIs can add wikis w/o having to make a pull request)  
Look for other similar wiki gathering efforts out there and include them here  
Add a 404 checker, and perhaps also a CI-like badge showing that all links are "OK: passing":
  -  Start here: https://github.com/search?q=404+checker&type=Repositories  
     and filter for Python after first having a look at good/simple lang-nonspecific repos solving this.
Categorize the wikis into "coding/computing", "general", and then alphabetically under those (for now).
